# TicTacToe
This is a basic version of Tic Tac Toe written in Python with a simple console UI. Feel free to reuse, develop and add your own UI.

How to run the app:
1. Download the files from this repository
2. The files can be opened with Jupyter notebook and require Python 3.0 to be executed. 
  a. If you do not have Python 3.0 installed, please visit https://www.anaconda.com/ and download the whole distribution of Python with Jupyter notebook included. 
  b.  If you have Python 3.0 installed, please download Jupyter Notebook from https://jupyter.org/. 
3. Once all software installed, open Jupyter Notebook in the location of Tic Tac Toe. In windows you can do it by typing "jupyter notebook" in your Windows Explorer path field. 
4. After Jupyter Notebook has opened, click the first block of code and hit Shift+Enter to execute it. 
5. Execute all the blocks one by one. Executing of the last block will run the actual game. 
6. Important: All blocks need to be executed first, before running the last one! Otherwise the game won't execute.

Have fun! :)
